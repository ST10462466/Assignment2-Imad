What is GitHub? 
Let us start with the word “Git” - what is it?
Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS) that tracks changes, enables collaborations, and allows developers to work independently before integrating updates. It uses commits, branches, and merges to manage code efficiently (Tu et Al., 2022).
Now according to Tu et Al. (2022), GitHub is a platform for storing and sharing Git Repositories, offering tools for collaboration, code review (Pull Requests), automation (GitHub Actions), and project management. It also serves as a social hub for developers to share and contribute to projects.

What is “yml” file and why do we use it?
This file is used in GitHub Actions. Then GitHub Actions is a platform that offers automation and a framework that was missing from Git. The file “yml” is used just to verify that the app runs correctly.
